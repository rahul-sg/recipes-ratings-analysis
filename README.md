1. Prediction Problem and Type:

Prediction Problem: The objective is to classify recipes into one of five rating categories based on available pre-rating information.
Type of Prediction: Multiclass classification. This approach is apt for predicting which of the several rating categories a recipe will fall into based on its characteristics.
2. Response Variable:

Response Variable: The 'rating' of a recipe, categorized into 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 stars. Using ratings as categorical data allows for precise classification into predefined quality levels.
3. Evaluation Metric:

Metric Choice: Accuracy and F1-Score. Accuracy will be the primary metric to determine the overall effectiveness of the classifier across all categories. However, given the likely imbalance among the categories (some ratings may be more common than others), the F1-Score, which balances precision and recall, will also be crucial.
Comparison: While accuracy gives a straightforward percentage of correct predictions, F1-Score provides a better measure of the model's performance in terms of balancing false positives and false negatives, which is important in an unbalanced dataset.
